# Finbourne.GenericCache

Finbourne.GenericCache.Memory is a simple in-memory caching library for .NET. It provides a generic cache implementation that allows you to store and retrieve data with a limited capacity. When the cache reaches its capacity, the least recently used (LRU) item is automatically removed to make space for new entries.

# Example
Solution includes a project Finbourne.GenricCache.Example to test the functionality which can be set as startup project and runs as a console application. 

# Unit Tests
Solution includes a project Finbourne.GenericCache.Test to run unit test cases and see the functionality asserting true/false to check different scenarios of the implementation
